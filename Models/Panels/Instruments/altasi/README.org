* Introduction:  

The Alt-ASI is a standby gauge, backing up the primary altimeter and air speed indicator guages.  
This instrument features readings for setting the altitude pressure in both millibars (MB) and inches of Mercury (InHg).

* Operation:
  
** SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:  
   
*Warning*: The Alt-ASI pressure setting must be callibrated to the local barometric pressure below transtion altitudes (TA) to obtain a reliable altitude reading.

1. Verify the local barometric pressure before setting the instrument.
2. Turn the BARO knob to set the current atmospheric pressure.	
3. The two pressure indicators, the altitude readout and the sweep dial will all move accordingly to the correct altitude.
4. Set the pressure to standard (1013/29.92), anytime the aircraft is flying above the Transition Altitude, by rotation of the BARO knob, or by pulling the knob, clicking on the mouse wheel.
5. The air speed tape cannot be adjusted by the pilot.  It will automatically move when the aircraft begins to move.

** FAILURE NOTICE: 
   
*Warning*: This device can fail if the internal workings of the gauge are damaged.

For flood and backlighting see "[[../PanelLighting][Panel Lighting]]"

*Location*: Two instruments for pilot and first officer located in the main instrument panel.

* Features

This altasi contains:

1. The instrument is divided into two sections.  
   1.The top half is the altimeter.
   2. The lower half is the air speed indicator.
2. The Altimeter consists of seven parts:
   1. A dial knob with the word "BARO" used to adjust for the local atmospheric pressure.
      + The BARO knob adusts both of the readouts automatically when turned up or down.
      + The BARO knob sets standard pressure if pulled (middle button click)
   2. On the left the readout is in millibars (MB)
   3. On the right the readout is in inches of mercury (InHg).
   4. The altimeter rose indicates a 100 feet increment, for each mark
   5. The digital altitude readout shows four digits when below 10,000 ft. A mask covers the fifth digit until 10,000 feet is reached.
   6. The instrument is a one-needle design.  The sweep shows the altitude per hundred feet.  The digital readout indicates the barometric altitude.
   7. A signal NEG appears, when the pressure altitude is below 0 ft
3. The Air Speed Indicator.
   1. The ASI tape shows the Indicated Airspeed in Knots (KIAS).
   2. The maximum airspeed for this instrument is 380 knots.  
   3. The hash marks provide a visual reminder of the gauge's upper limit.
