* Introduction

The dials are multifunctional, controlling the light to the panel, 
and the instruments, as well as having an automatic setting that turns on the lights at dusk.

* Operation:

1. The panel consists of two dials:
	1. One is labeled "Panel" and the other is labeled "Flood."
	2. Both dials are clearly marked where the "Off" position is.
	3. On the right edge of the panel are the letters "INST LT", which are abbreviations for "Instrument Lights."
2.  Both dials are dimmer switches. Turning them to the right increases the light's brightness.
	1. The dials operate independently. They can be used in tandem or individually.
	2. The left Panel dial controls the backlighting for the instruments.
	3. The right flood dial controls the flood lights of the entire panel.
	4. Turning either dial up allows the pilot to set the desired level of illumination for the circumstances.
3.  Automatic setting.
	1. Turning either dial to the maximum right turns on the automatic function.
	2. In this position, the instrument and panel lights will turn on at dusk, when light drops below a certain level. 
	3. The light also automatically turns itself off at dawn, when the natural light reaches a certain level.
4. IRCM leds on the left of the instrument informs status of the flares

** STANDARD OPERATION

In most cases it is advisable during the preflight check to turn up the panel light at least half way, 
so the changing light conditions in the sky do not interfere with one's ability to see the instruments, 
since the light can change faster than our eyes can adjust.

** FAILURE NOTICE

In the event of a power loss to the aircraft, the lighting system is tied to the backup electrical power.

*Location*: Left or Right of the HUDs.


* Features: Automatic Light setting

The Instrument Lights contains these separate elements:

1. Two light adjusting dials
	1. A setting for off
	2. A setting for automatic operation in low-light or dark conditions.
2. A face plate with backlit symbols to aid simplicity of operation.
3. IRCM situation indicators
