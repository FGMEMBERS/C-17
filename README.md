V2.6
-----

* Some cockpit instrumentation fitted. to turn on the Glass cockpit, use the Autostart function in the C17 menu ( its not linked to the engines yet ).
* The Autopilot panel does interface with the Autopilot and also the f11 autopilot dialogue box.
* I put a simple interior in the Cargo bay to cover the roughness of its standard interior. Perhaps someone with better skills can improve on what I have done.
* You can now add payload to the C17 and see the payload in the cargo bay if you use the loadmasters view. The payload weight does affect flight performance.
* Added the HUD Glass to to cockpit and a new hud to go with with it.
* All new paratrooper model ( uses the same chute animation though ) Use Ctrl-J to start them jumping
