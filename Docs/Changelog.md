I don't have a play by play but so far here is what has been done.  Maybe in the future I will document changes more thoroughly.

1. JSBSIM data model built
	a. Researched plane and made as realistic as possible
	b. Used a spreadsheet I made to record and check FDM
	c. Used Paint.net for all measurements and used a scale factor
	d. Animated control surfaces
	e. Animated cargo door and cargo ramp
	f. Animated landing gear

2. PW2043 P&W Engine model built

3. 3D Model Modifications
	a. Cut Out surfaces for animation (Flaps, Ailerons, Rudder, Elevator)
	b. Cut Out Wheel Wells
	c. Cut Out cargo ramp and cargo door, made top of ramp flat
	d. Made ramp extensions for the cargo ramp
	e. Made new landing gear for plane, kept original wheels
	f. Added fans for engines
		
4. Textures 
	a. Made a realistic tire texture 
	b. Modified the F-14 wheel texture and added it to the C-17
	c. Changed the color of the windows
	d. Added yellow lines to winglets
	e. Remapped the entire plane at least half a dozen times

_30 May 2013 (Has it really been that long?)_

1.  I never liked the top of the tail so I made a whole new one.  
2.  Tweaked the JSBSim file to add more realistic simulation of winglets and blown flaps.  It works pretty good.
3.  Added on to the Cargobay model so it looks a little better from the inside.
4.  Added Tail, Co-Pilot & Loadmaster views
5.  I didn't touch the YASIM version.  I hope everything still works.
