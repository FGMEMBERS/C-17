Hi Jon,

Sure, should be no problem here. Just include the original readme text file with the authors info in there somewhere if you can.
If I get around to doing an update on the X-Plane side I'll mention there's a flight gear version also if you like.

Will have to check out flight gear, looks like its improved rather a bit over the years.

Cheers,

_Adam._

Mr. Adam Fothergill,

I am developing a C-17 for www.flightgear.org and would like to use the 3D model/paint from your X-Plane C-17.  Flightgear is open source and I need your permission to publish.  Please see e-mail traffic below.

Jon,

I do not have a problem with releasing the aircraft model and paint, and any improvements flow back to the X-Plane model. 

You will need to contact Adam Fothergill, though, as he alone developed the 3-D model. It's probably best to do that at www.jaffamountain.com because he visits the .org web site infrequently. Adam develops computer games (XBox360 and others) and got too busy doing that, so I manage the C-17 file for him, keeping it up to date. He has the final say about restrictions on the files further use.

I hope I am talking to the right person. If not maybe you could send me in the right direction.

I'm e-mailing you to ask you permission to use the 3D model from the X-plane C-17 V1.2 and also the textures. I am an active duty Air Force avionics technician and was recently stationed at McChord AFB WA. I wanted to build a C-17 for Flightgear http:\\www.flightgear.org which is an open source flight simulation program that is used by many universities. I wanted to build a C-17 for Flightgear a. so I could contribute to the flying simulation community and b. so I would get an education on the C-17.

I built the flight data model myself using JSBSim and now I would like to use your 3D model and texture of aircraft 0174 "Let's Roll" as I have no ability to make a 3D model myself. Of course I would cite you and I believe the other author is Adam Fothergill as the makers of the 3D model. I would just require your permission to publish the model as part of my package to the GPL community.

I thank you for your consideration.
