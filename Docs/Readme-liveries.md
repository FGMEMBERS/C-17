## How to create high res liveries with a small file size.

:airplane: 

You will find a folder called `PNG Graphics` in the models folder. this contains the master liveries in `PNG` format at `4096x4094`.

Use this `PNG` file to create  further liveries but _DO NOT SAVE OVER IT_. When saving your new liveries  use _SAVE AS_ and save your new livery as a compressed  `JPEG` at `1024x1024`.

By doing this you still have the high resolution details  in your livery and have actual livery files with a tiny file size which will load fast even on low end  machines.

Creating new liveries as `PNG` files  at the full `4096x4096` resolution will result is older PC's and Mac ether suffering very low frame rates or not loading at all.

### EDITING LIVERIES 

_DO NOT_ edit a `JPEG` livery, you will loose the quality if you attempt to edit it. It is suggested you keep a `PNG` version of your livery for editing until you are satisfied with your resulting `JPEG` version.
